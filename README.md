# Bilingualism and development of children with ASD - scientific findings and the perspective of parents and experts

Autism is a developmental disorder characterised by difficulties in social communication and limited behavioural patterns and interests. The contemporary understanding of autism is that of a spectrum, including a variety of autistic characteristics. One such characteristic is atypical speech development, which, up until recently, had been the basis for speech therapists and professionals advising against children on a spectrum of growing up in bilingual environments. An overview of the research regarding the influence of bilingualism in autism has been presented in this thesis, focusing in particular on bilingual on-the-spectrum children's social communication and cognitive abilities. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that bilingualism does not negatively affect the development of autistic children. The ability of children with autism to proficiently use multiple languages makes them bond stronger with their family and culture. The obstacles hindering children's development have also been discussed. This thesis also describes the perspectives of parents and professionals working with children on the spectrum. Recommendations were made regarding the education system and the developmental support of bilingual children with autism.
